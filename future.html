                    <h1>And My Future</h1>
                    <p>Now, being a student commencing <span>Bachelor of Information Technology and Bachelor of Business</span>, I am learning and improving myself day by day. I want to become a Software Engineer, so I am preparing and honing the crucial skills for the position. </p>
                    <p>Towards that pathway, Web Systems is absolutely a fundamental subject paving the foundation for my career. In the short term, I plan to gain at least 4 Distinction for the 4 subjects I am doing this semester. This would help me to make my academic achievement perspective more distinctive in my career profile later. Moreover, if possible, I aim to earn Deanâ€™s List Award from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology during my college years. I also plan to join several societies for networking next year, as well as developing my practical competencies by participating in Hackathon competitions.</p>
                    <p>Overall, that is the plan for 4 years here at UTS. Hopefully I will accomplish whatever I set and enjoy those beautiful college time abroad.</p>
